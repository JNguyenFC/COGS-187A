					<br><div id="itemsummary"><p><b>If you're looking for great tasting coffee that does the trick this place never fails. </b>It is two doors down from Gym Standard and I usually always stop by both places whenever I'm in the area or if I'm feeling up for the drive. There is street parking with meters or you can sometimes find parking in the neighborhoods, which isn't too much of a walk. </p>

					<p>The atmosphere and design of the place is minimal yet effective. I'm all about minimal design that is straight to the point. The drinks usually range from $3-5. I usually go for the 20oz cold brew with milk and add the cubes of sugar that are set off near the entrance. There isn't much seating but most people are on the go in that particular area. </p>

					<p>If you're digging the brand make sure to grab a mug or shirt. I've yet to try the waffle but I do see them in my future.</p>

					<br><div id="itemsummary"><p>Great coffee and great atmosphere.  I highly recommend their Cold Brew.  Get a 20oz.  I like it enough that I have a growler from them.  Their cold brew is that good!  If you are looking for something to eat, get yourself a waffle.  It's delicious.  And if cold coffee isn't your thing, their pour over coffee is nothing less than fantastic.  You can't go wrong.  <b>Everyone that works here is friendly and knowledgeable about the coffee and the tea that they sell. </b>So stop on by and give them a try if you haven't already.

					<p>UPDATE from my previous review.  Coffee and Tea Collective doesn't have a "secret menu."  My review from awhile ago was correct during that time.  But they have since change it.</p>

					<br><div id="itemsummary"><p>So. HIPSTER. And I don't even mean that as an insult. I'm from SF, which is right behind Portland in terms of hipster-dom. So I felt right at home here. </p>

					<p>Excellent coffee. You get what you pay for. <b>Also, they cater to the anti-social of the world who want to bury themselves in their laptops without the risk of accidental eye contact by providing plenty of stools at the counter. None of which face each other. PERFECT.</p></b>

					<p>Good music, chill vibe, quiet enough to get some work done. Also, best mustaches in town. Seriously, Baristas. Keep that shit up.</p>

					<br><div id="itemsummary"><p>One of the five best espressos in San Diego. Seriously they make amazing coffee. <b>You can taste the difference after coming here. </b>Downsides are its a little more expensive than your more generic coffee place, but you really are paying for superior quality drinks here. Most of the baristas are amazing and helpful. A few are extremely smug and elitist. There are not a ton of places to sit, but generally you can find a spot, at least for a quick drink.</p>

					<p>The vibe is minimalist and hipster. I think its a good place to sit and read early in the morning, but not ideal for long studying. If you love a seriously amazing espresso or pour over give this place a try. I'm a huge fan and a frequent customer.rom awhile ago was correct during that time.  But they have since change it.</p>

					<br><div id="itemsummary"><p>Great minimalist coffee shop in San Diego, decor was streamlined and simple unlike the other places I've visited so far here... <b>The coffee was great, my husband and I both had cappuccinos, and the Belgian waffle was amazing.</b> Had to stop myself from getting another... </p>

					<p>Only annoyance we had was that the service was extremely slow, even though the shop was not busy at all. The barista at the register had a full conversation with a prior customer who'd already been served before he meandered over to us. Took about 15 mins for two caps and another two for the waffle. Not the best place to go to in a hurry, but definitely one to stop by if you want a great coffee.</p>
