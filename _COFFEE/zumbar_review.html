					<br><div id="itemsummary"><p>So excited that my work moved down the street from this place!  Now I have to monitor my weekly coffee budget haha.  <b>High quality coffee at awesome prices</b>.  I would take this over Starbucks any day.  Storefront doesn't say Zumbar (I wonder why), it only says "Coffee Shop".  It's in a small strip mall by the Sorrento Valley Coaster Station.  Easy to miss if you didn't know it was there.  </p>

<p>Their drinks are <b>traditional</b> here.  A Macchiato (which the barista and owner nicely schooled me about) is not like Starbucks.  It's two shots of espresso with a lil bit of foam on top, served in a small cup.  Latte's are delicious.  French press is the way to go if you're dining in .  They give you the whole french press at your table so it's enough for two cups of coffee.</p><br><p>Posted October 29th, 2013</p>

					<br><div id="itemsummary"><p>I have been a fan of Zumbar long before I ever stepped foot into this storefront.</p>

<p>My brother and I have coffee competitions.  We find local roasters and buy bags and then have coffee tastings to see who wins.  I discovered that Zumbar not only had a shop, but also <b>roasted its own beans</b>.  Score.  So, I bought some.  Then I bought more.  And more.  I've tried a few different roasts and have loved them all.  I've ordered online and I've also purchased beans at a local gelato shop that endorses Zumbar coffee beans.</p>

<p>I have never been into the actual storefront simply because I never find myself in Sorrento Valley, and if/when I am in the area, it's closed.  I'm off work at 5:00... they close at 5:00.  I haven't had an excuse to stop in for a latte until today, when I had to drop a friend at the airport suuuuper early and decided I would splurge and go in. </p> 

<p>They were friendly, helpful, made a <b>perfect soy latte</b>, helped me select a new roast to buy, and gave me two free drink coupons to use at their new store that opens today in Cardiff.  Plus, when they asked if I wanted the coffee beans ground and I answered, "And ruin them?" the guy told me that was the best answer he'd ever heard.  </p>

<p>I will definitely be hitting up the Cardiff location.  Great local coffee... beats out the others in San Diego for sure.</p><p><br><p>Posted October 23rd, 2013</p>

					<br><div id="itemsummary"><p>Just saying, don't go to this place if you liked mixed coffee drinks. This place is much more <b>traditional</b> (and hipster).</p>

<p>My boss recommended this place for weeks before we made a trip there. I was not much of a coffee person to begin with so I did not know what to expect. I like to order the standard Latte there and it was delicious. The first thing was that the coffee was not scolding hot, you can drink it immediately - a big plus in my book. Second was the quality of the beans. They roast their own beans in-house so it is extremely fresh and <b>extremely smooth</b>. I love it so much that I have bought their <b>Hummingbird</b> whole beans myself!</p><p><br><p>Posted November 9th, 2013</p>

					<br><div id="itemsummary"><p>Great coffee. I mean, <b>EXCELLENT</b> coffee. They have a micro-roaster and they really do make the most of their beans. </p>

<p>I like the vibe. I like that it is a local business. </p>

<p>If you happen to come by the Sorrento Valley train station and you like coffee, grab an espresso drink and be ready to have your <b>MIND BLOWN!</b></p> 

<p>(Missing a star because their food options are limited - but admittedly, I don't go for the food)</p><p><br><p>Posted November 21st, 2013</p>

					<br><div id="itemsummary"><p>My <b>fave local coffee shop</b>. They make the best latte because their baristas know how to consistently pull their espressos. They also magically know how to steam the milk at the <b>perfect temperature</b>. Most of all, they have the best freshly roasted Ethiopian coffee!! It's a no nonsense coffee shop and in the mornings I really don't care for much fake pep so the "too cool for school" attitude does not really bother me.</p><p><br><p>Posted December 26th, 2013</p>
